## 🎉 What's New in 3D Version

This is a **complete rewrite** of the Damascus Pattern Simulator using real 3D physics and mesh-based simulation. The old 2D pixel-based simulator has been deprecated in favor of this more accurate and powerful 3D engine.

### Major Features

## 🎮 Usage

### Launch the Application
```bash
./damascus_3d_gui.py
```

Or use the desktop launcher: `Damascus Pattern Simulator`

### Recommended Workflow (BETA)

**For best results, start with these tested features:**

1. **Create a Billet**
   - Set layer count (default: 30 layers - TESTED)
   - Set layer thickness (white/black: 0.8mm each)
   - Set billet dimensions (width × length, keep under 200mm for performance)
   - Click "Create New Billet"

2. **Configure Build Plate**
   - Adjust width/length in "Build Plate (Workspace)" section
   - Default: 400×400mm (WORKING)
   - Auto-resize will trigger if billet exceeds plate size (WORKING)

3. **Forge the Billet** ✅ **RECOMMENDED - FULLY TESTED**
   - Click "🔨 Forge to Square Bar" or "⬡ Forge to Octagon Bar"
   - Enter target bar size (try 15-25mm for good results)
   - Set number of heats (3-7 recommended)
   - Click "Forge"
   - Choose auto-resize if bar exceeds build plate

4. **Export Your Work**
   - 💾 Save 3D Model (.obj format) - WORKING
   - 🖼️ Save Cross-Section (PNG image) - WORKING
   - 📋 Save Operation Log (JSON) - WORKING

5. **Pattern Operations** ⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL - USE WITH CAUTION**
   - These features are implemented but not fully tested
   - May produce unexpected results
   - Save your work before applying patterns
   - If something goes wrong, use "🔄 Reset Billet"

## 📊 Build Plate System ✅ (WORKING)

### What is the Build Plate?
The build plate represents your workspace - a fixed area where billets can be placed. This mimics real-world manufacturing where you have workspace constraints.

### Features
- **Static Reference Frame**: Viewport doesn't resize with every billet change ✅
- **Visual Boundary**: Dashed gray rectangle shows workspace limits ✅
- **Intelligent Warnings**: Alerts when billet or forged bar exceeds plate size ✅
- **Auto-Resize**: One-click adjustment to fit oversized billets ✅

### Auto-Resize Options
When a billet exceeds the build plate, you get three choices:
1. **📐 Auto-Resize Build Plate**: Automatically adjusts to 110% of needed size (squared for symmetry)
2. **✓ Continue Anyway**: Proceed with oversized billet (for visualization purposes)
3. **✗ Cancel**: Abort the operation

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture
- **GUI**: Tkinter-based with matplotlib 3D viewport
- **3D Engine**: Open3D for mesh operations
- **Physics**: Volume-conserving transformations
- **Coordinate System**: X=width, Y=length, Z=height (layers stack in Z)

### Forging Physics (VERIFIED WORKING)
Real forging physics using volume conservation:
```
V = width × length × height = constant
```

For a square bar:
```
final_length = original_volume / (target_size²)
```

Example: 50×100×24mm billet → 20×20mm square = 300mm long bar (3× extension)

- `damascus_3d_simulator.py` - 3D physics engine (1,400+ lines)
- `3D_DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md` - Detailed development documentation

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Critical Issues
⚠️ **NO UNDO FUNCTIONALITY** - Once an operation is applied, you cannot undo it. Use "Reset Billet" to start over.  
⚠️ **PATTERN OPERATIONS UNTESTED** - Twist, Feather, and Raindrop patterns are implemented but not fully tested.  
⚠️ **MUST FORGE BEFORE TWIST** - Twist operation requires forging to square or octagon first (validation enforced).  

### Known Limitations
1. **Z-axis not validated**: Only X/Y dimensions checked against build plate
2. **Single billet only**: Can't place multiple billets on build plate
3. **No animation**: Operations apply instantly (no gradual visualization)
4. **Limited undo**: Only "Reset Billet" available (loses all work)

### Performance Notes
- Large billets (>100 layers) may render slowly
- Forging with many heats (>10) takes longer but produces smoother results
- Cross-section extraction is fast (<0.1s typically)
- First render may take a few seconds to initialize Open3D

### Stability
- **Generally stable** for billet creation and forging operations
- **May crash** during experimental pattern operations
- **Save your work frequently** using export functions
- Check debug logs (`damascus_3d_debug_*.log`) if crashes occur

## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice

### Old 2D Simulator
The original 2D pixel-based simulator (`damascus_simulator.py`) is **DEPRECATED** and should **NOT BE USED**.

**Status**: Kept in repository for reference only  
**Maintenance**: None - no bug fixes or updates  
**Recommended**: Use 3D version (`damascus_3d_gui.py`) instead  

**Why deprecated?**
- Limited to 2D cross-sections (no true 3D geometry)
- Pixel-based rendering (not scalable)
- No realistic physics modeling
- Limited pattern types
