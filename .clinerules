# Damascus Pattern Simulator - Project Rules

## Code Style
- Use 4-space indentation (no tabs)
- Keep functions under 100 lines when possible
- Add comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Always include docstrings for functions
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the codebase

## Debug Logging
- Use self.debug_print() for all important operations
- Include function parameters in debug messages
- Log both entry and exit of major functions
- Always catch exceptions and log with traceback
- Debug messages should only appear when debug mode is enabled

## Git Commits
- Do NOT push to GitHub unless explicitly asked by the user
- Include co-author line in commits: Co-Authored-By: Warp <agent@warp.dev>
- Write descriptive commit messages with bullet points
- Commit related changes together as logical units

## Damascus Simulator Specific
- Pattern functions should validate inputs before processing
- Transformations should return original pattern on error (graceful degradation)
- UI changes must not break existing functionality
- Test pattern generation after making changes
- All pattern creation functions should follow the try-catch pattern
- Maintain compatibility with existing saved patterns

## Testing
- Run the application to verify changes before committing
- Test new patterns with transformations (twist, grind, mosaic, rotation)
- Verify debug logging works when debug mode is enabled
- Check that error handling doesn't crash the application

## User Interaction
- Wait for user approval before making large architectural changes
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Do not make assumptions about forging techniques without research
- Respect user feedback on pattern appearance and behavior
